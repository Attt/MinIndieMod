# MinIndie

This theme is **heavily** based on [smol](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/smol/), a minimalist hugo theme, thanks to their work!

MinIndie is a very minimal hugo theme with indieweb markups. A demo can be found on my blog at https://bacardi55.io

## Features

- No JavaScript
- No Google spyware or tracking of any kind
- No other external dependencies, embedded fonts or comment sections
- Dark mode support (depending on your OS's setting)
- Indieweb markup

## Installation

In your Hugo site `themes` directory, run:

```
git clone https://
```

Next, open `config.toml` in the base of the Hugo site and ensure the theme option is set to `smol`.

```
theme = "minindie"
```

Lastly, add the following lines to your `config.toml` to set site parameters and make use of all the menu entries in the header and footer sections if you need them.

```
title = "Site Name"
baseURL = "https://your.domain.tld"
copyright = "A copyright message"
